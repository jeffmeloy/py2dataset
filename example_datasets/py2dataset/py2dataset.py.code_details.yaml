py2dataset/py2dataset.py:
  Code Documentation:
  - 'I) The purpose of 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py' is creating a Python software aimed at generating and storing question-answer pair datasets by inspecting and processing various aspects of one or multiple given Python files from specific directories (with additional flexibility for interactivity during runtime). This information can later be employed to understand the code better through machine learning models or other analysis tools. It consists of several functions working together to achieve this goal: process_single_python_file, py2dataset, clone_github_repo, get_bool_from_input (used only for interactive mode), and main - the entry point when executing the script.
    II) Detailed Requirements & API Signatures for all Functions & Class Methods:

    - url (str): URL of the GitHub repository
    - Returns (str): Local path of the cloned repository
    4. main(): Command-line entry point for processing Python files and generating datasets. It parses command-line arguments, handles interactive mode if enabled, adjusts parameters accordingly, checks validity of start directory, calls py2dataset with derived parameters, and executes clone_github_repo if necessary.
    - No explicit inputs or returns but interacts with various global variables defined in the script
    5. get_bool_from_input(input_str: str, current_value: bool): An auxiliary function used only during interactive mode to obtain user input for changing parameters and converts it into boolean values. It checks if input matches true/false keywords or keeps the existing value if none provided.
    - input_str (str): User input string from prompt
    - current_value (bool): Default boolean value of the parameter being updated
    - Returns: current_value, True, False depending on user input matching true/false keywords
    III) Explanation of Inputs, Variables, Calls & Returns in the code:
    1. In process_single_python_file():
    - Input parameters represent necessary data for processing a Python file's details and instruct.json dataset generation while handling LLM integration when needed. Logging is utilized to keep track of progress; get_model instantiates an LLM model config if use_llm = True with no given config but model_config still takes configured parameters through the calling py2dataset function later
    - process spawns child threads to execute py2dataset when use_llm & single_process are False or runs all files sequentially otherwise. It saves file details and instruct.json data using save_python_data after fetching Python file information with get_python_file_details, acquiring datasets via get_python_datasets, handling exceptions if any
    - Variables hold intermediate steps of processing while returns nothing as it operates internally for each Python file
    2. In py2dataset():
    - Arguments control the overall behavior of dataset generation and storage. It adjusts logging levels based on quiet mode, sets output directory using get_output_dir if start is invalid or empty, retrieves questions dictionary with get_questions, searches for Python files recursively excluding specific directories, processes each file either sequentially or in parallel depending on LLM usage and single_process flag
    - Returns combined instruct.json datasets after combining json files using combine_json_files (HTML generation can also be controlled via html argument)
    3. In clone_github_repo():
    - url serves as the GitHub repository path, attempts to clone it or fetch latest changes if local copy exists already, and returns its local path after handling errors during operation
    - Variables are related to cloning operations like repo_name, repo_path while return value is the actual path of the cloned repository
    4. In main():
    - It handles command-line arguments parsing (with get_bool_from_input for interactive mode), adjusts parameters accordingly based on user input or defaults if needed, validates start directory, executes py2dataset with derived parameters, and invokes clone_github_repo if required
    - No explicit returns but interacts with various global variables defined in the script to execute the overall process
    5. In get_bool_from_input():
    - Two main arguments impact how current_value adjusts as user input comes: whether matching 'True', 'False' or just press Enter
    - It only modifies global values according to users input within interactive mode
    & returns updated current_values of either true, false'

  py2dataset:
    Inputs:
      Value: start, output_dir, questions_pathname, model_config_pathname, use_llm, quiet, single_process, detailed, html, skip_regen
      Purpose: 'In the context of 'py2dataset', these inputs serve crucial roles for configuring its behavior while generating datasets from Python files within specified directories. Their purpose and significance can be explained as follows:
        1. start: This input represents either a starting directory containing Python files or a GitHub repository URL pointing to Python files. If it starts with "https://github.com/", `py2dataset` will clone the repository using 'clone_github_repo' function and process its Python scripts. Otherwise, if empty or invalid, it defaults to the current working directory.
        2. output_dir: It specifies the target directory where generated datasets (instruct.json files) should be stored. By default, it sets the path as "./dataset/".
        3. questions_pathname: This parameter indicates the path and filename of a JSON file containing predefined questions about Python scripts that `py2dataset` will use to generate relevant answers during analysis. The default value is "./py2dataset_questions.json".
        4. model_config_pathname: It defines the path and filename of a configuration file for the LLM (Language Model) used in generating responses for certain questions. If not provided, `py2dataset` attempts to instantiate an LLM model using 'get_model' within 'process_single_python_file'. The default value is "./py2dataset_model_config.yaml".
        5. use_llm: As a boolean flag, this parameter decides whether the Language Model will be leveraged to answer specific code purpose questions within Python scripts being processed. Its default setting is False - no LLM utilization for generating question-answer pairs and datasets without enabling the additional expenses in computational cost or resources usage related to larger AI models.
        6. quiet: If set to True, it reduces logging output during `py2dataset` execution to limit excessive console messages while processing Python files. By default, it's False allowing regular information flow during analysis and operation progress tracking.
        7. single_process: When LLM integration is activated via 'use_llm', setting this parameter to True makes `py2dataset` process all Python files in a single thread instead of spawning multiple child processes for better memory management. The default value is False, which uses multiple processes by default when 'use_llm' is enabled.
        8. detailed: This flag determines whether the analysis performed by `py2dataset` should be more comprehensive or not. If True, it includes additional details in generated datasets. By default, it remains False with less elaborate information output.
        9. html: As a boolean input, 'html' decides if `py2dataset` generates HTML output along with JSON files containing question-answer pairs and instructions. Its default value is False - only JSON datasets are produced without HTML formatting.
        10. skip_regen: When True, this parameter instructs `py2dataset` to skip regeneration of existing instruct.json files during analysis. If False by default, it will reprocess Python scripts even if their corresponding instruct.json files already exist in the output directory.

        12. base_pathname.with_suffix(".py.instruct.json") and instruct_pathname.exists(): These calls help determine whether an existing instruct.json file needs regeneration by appending the suffix ".py.instruct.json" to create a new output path or checking if it already exists before proceeding with processing for that particular Python file.
        13. Process(): The multiprocessing library class, instantiated as proc objects for launching separate child processes to manage memory usage during `process_single_python_file` execution when using LLM but single_process is False. It starts the process with 'proc.start()' and waits for completion using 'proc.join()'.
        14. process_single_python_file: This function generates question-answer pairs and instructions for individual Python files based on configurations, detailed analysis (if required), and model usage as directed by the given parameters before storing results into relevant folders with `save_python_data`. It may execute either in multiple child processes or single-threaded operation.
        15. combine_json_files: Merges all generated instruct.json files into a single dataset output (with HTML generation control via html argument). This function is called after processing each Python file individually to consolidate results for easier access and analysis.'

      Purpose: 'In the context of 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', these variables play crucial roles in generating datasets by processing Python files within specified directories and managing various aspects related to logging, configuration, file handling, and output generation. Here's a breakdown for each variable mentioned:
        1. proc (within process_single_python_file): This is a Process object created when using LLM with single_process set as False during dataset generation. It runs separate processes to manage memory while working on individual Python files in parallel. When single_process is True, it's not used; instead, all files are processed sequentially within the function itself.
        2. questions_pathname: This variable represents the path and filename of the file containing predefined questions about Python files that py2dataset will use during analysis. It helps tailor the generated datasets to specific queries relevant to code understanding. Default value is "./py2dataset_questions.json".
        3. instruct_pathname (not directly in py2dataset but created within): This temporary variable appears while processing individual Python files inside process_single_python_file. It holds the path combining the output directory with relative file location suffixed by ".py.instruct.json" for unique storage of each generated dataset.
        4. params: This is a dictionary containing configuration options passed throughout different functions within py2dataset, collecting input arguments provided via command line or defaults when missing. It consolidates settings related to starting directory, output path, questions file, LLM usage, logging level, detailed analysis, HTML generation, skipping regeneration of existing instruct.json files, etc.
        5. single_process (within py2dataset): This boolean flag determines whether to use a single process for Python file processing when LLM is used in dataset generation or spawn multiple child processes for better memory management. Default value is False meaning multiple processes are generally utilized.

        7. use_llm (within py2dataset): A boolean flag indicating whether LLM should be used for answering code purpose questions within generated datasets. Default value is False meaning LLM won't be utilized unless explicitly specified during runtime.
        8. detailed (within py2dataset): This boolean variable controls including extra details in analysis if set to True while generating datasets. Detailed inspection can provide more context about Python files but might impact performance and output size. Default value is False for minimal analysis.
        9. model_config & model_config_pathname: While not directly inside py2dataset function, these variables relate to LLM configuration details necessary when use_llm equals True during processing Python files. model_config holds the actual configuration while model_config_pathname stores its path and filename as specified by user input or defaulted to "./py2dataset_model_config.yaml".
        10. start (within py2dataset): This string variable represents the starting directory for Python files or GitHub repository Python files during dataset generation. If empty or invalid, it defaults to current working directory (".").
        11. output_dir (within py2dataset): Path representing where generated datasets will be stored. Default value is "./dataset/".
        12. exclude_dirs: A list containing directories within Python file paths that should be skipped during search operations in py2dataset function. It helps avoid unnecessary processing of irrelevant files like "__pycache__", "build", "dist", and "_" starting directories.
        13. base_pathname (within clone_github_repo): Appears during git repository handling. Created temporarily during successful clone operation when "--start" specifies a GitHub URL. It holds the path to the cloned repository for further processing in py2dataset function.
        14. html (within py2dataset): A boolean flag determining whether HTML output should be generated along with datasets. Default value is False meaning plain JSON format will be used unless explicitly set otherwise during runtime.'
    Returns:
      Value: combine_json_files(output_dir, html, params['questions'])
      Purpose: 'Within the 'py2dataset' function context, the return value 'combine_json_files(output_dir, html, params["questions"])' represents the generated datasets resulting from processing Python files within a specified directory. This combination occurs after all individual instruct.json files have been produced through either parallel or sequential execution of process_single_python_file operations depending on provided parameters like single_process and use_llm. Let's break down each element returned:
        1. output_dir (str): It refers to the directory where the generated datasets will be stored as instruct.json files. This path is obtained using get_output_dir() function based on user input or default value "./dataset/".
        2. html (bool): If this parameter is set to True during py2dataset execution, it indicates generating HTML output alongside JSON datasets for better visualization purposes. However, its impact on combine_json_files() remains unclear in the given code snippet since the function signature doesn't show any explicit relationship with HTML generation.
        3. params['questions'] (Dict): This dictionary contains questions about Python files that need to be answered during dataset generation. It is read using get_questions() function from a file named "./py2dataset_questions.json" unless altered by user input in interactive mode or overridden with another path through command-line arguments.
        The significance of these returns lies in providing the final outcome after processing Python files within a directory - datasets containing question-answer pairs extracted from code analysis. These datasets can be further utilized for various purposes such as machine learning model training, static analysis improvements, or any other application requiring insights into Python code behavior. By combining instruct.json files generated by process_single_python_file(), combine_json_files() ensures consolidation of all relevant information in a single location specified by output_dir, thereby enabling users to access datasets efficiently after executing py2dataset().'
  clone_github_repo:
    Inputs:
      Value: url
      Purpose: 'In the context given, the function 'clone_github_repo' primarily deals with interacting with GitHub repositories by cloning them or fetching their latest changes if already present locally. It has one input parameter named 'url', which holds significant value as it represents the URL of a specific GitHub repository that needs to be processed.
        The purpose of providing this input in `clone_github_repo` function lies in enabling developers to retrieve code from a particular repository hosted on GitHub to further analyze and generate datasets for Python files inside that repo within py2dataset workflow.
        The GitHub repository URL carries information critical to initialize necessary steps towards either cloning (in case there's no existing copy locally) or updating an already downloaded version with the latest changes. This input helps users integrate external codebases into their analysis process seamlessly without manually handling Git operations themselves.'
    Calls:
      Value: Path, Path.cwd, repo_path.exists, Repo, repo.remote().fetch, repo.remote, repo.git.reset, Repo.clone_from, str, logging.info
      Purpose: 'In the 'clone_github_repo' function within the given context, various objects and methods are utilized to clone a GitHub repository or fetch its latest changes into the local system. Their purposes and significance can be explained as follows:
        1. Path: This built-in Python module provides classes for working with filesystem paths independently of operating systems. It's used in creating repository paths throughout the codebase.
        2. Path.cwd(): A static method from Path class that returns the current working directory path as a Path object. In 'clone_github_repo', it helps determine the default starting point for cloning operations if no URL is given indicating a local Git repository path.
        3. repo_path.exists(): This operation checks whether the returned local repository path ('repo_path') exists after attempting to clone or fetch changes from GitHub. If it does exist, further actions related to resetting or regenerating repository contents are skipped as no new cloning process is necessary at present.
        4. Repo: It is an instance of a Python module (part of 'git' library) enabling handling local and remote Git repositories management, particularly during Git repository clone and manipulation procedures within our script. Here it stores or modifies different repo objects dynamically during GitHub actions execution.
        5. repo_remote().fetch(): A method called on Repo instance after creating a local repository object using 'Repo.clone_from'. It fetches the latest changes from remote origin into the current working clone directory.
        6. repo_remote: Attribute accessed from previously created Repo object allowing interactions related to remotes operations, especially during fetching steps of our script when getting updates from GitHub repositories.
        7. repo_git.reset(): This method is called on Repo instance after fetching changes to reset the repository to a specific commit (hard reset). It discards all local modifications and moves the HEAD pointer to that commit hash, ensuring consistency with remote origin contents.
        8. Repo.clone_from(): A constructor of Repo class used in 'clone_github_repo' function to clone a GitHub repository into the specified path ('repo_path'). It creates a local copy of the remote repository if required during runtime.
        9. str: This built-in Python type converts objects to string representation as needed in logging messages for clarity or storing URLs/paths within the script.
        10. logging.info(): A function from Python's 'logging' module used extensively throughout the codebase for outputting informational messages about Git operations status or error scenarios. In this case, it reports errors while processing repositories during repository cloning procedures if any arise.'
    Variables:
      Value: repo_name, repo_path, repo, url
      Purpose: 'In the context given from 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', the variables 'repo_name', 'repo_path', 'repo', and 'url' are integral parts of the 'clone_github_repo' function which primarily focuses on cloning a GitHub repository or fetching its latest changes locally. Each variable serves a distinct purpose within this function as described below:
        1. repo_name: This variable represents the name of the cloned repository extracted from the provided URL. It helps create a user-friendly reference to identify the specific repository during the code execution. Since Path uses stem from the URL for its name, repo_name acts as an identifier within the local file system.
        2. repo_path: It signifies the actual path where the cloned GitHub repository will be stored locally on the user's machine. The 'repo_path' variable combines a default directory ("githubrepos") with repo_name, thus organizing cloned repositories in an organized manner for future accessibility or other operations.
        3. repo: This object is an instance of Git repository class from the 'git' library used to interact with the local clone after creating it. Repo offers methods like fetch() and git.reset() which assist in updating or resetting the repository contents to match remote branches, respectively. Its presence ensures efficient handling of already existing cloned repositories by updating them instead of cloning again if needed.
        4. url: The primary input argument for 'clone_github_repo', it represents the URL address leading directly to the GitHub repository which the user intends to clone or update. The function initiates either Repo creation ('Repo.clone_from' if none exists locally) or updating with fetch/reset operations (if present already). This URL acts as a link connecting 'py2dataset' codebase with the desired remote Git repository resource.
        To summarize, repo_name identifies cloned repositories, repo_path stores their location on disk, repo manages interactions with the local clone using Git commands, while url initiates cloning/updating processes in relation to a specific GitHub repository URL within 'clone_github_repo'. Together they facilitate smooth integration of remote codebases into the Python script's workflow.'
    Returns:
      Value: str(repo_path)
      Purpose: 'Within the context given in 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', the function `clone_github_repo(url: str)` serves to manage Git operations related to cloning a repository from GitHub or fetching its latest changes if already available locally. Its primary objective is to prepare a local version of the specified repository for further processing in the code pipeline. It returns a significant output - `str(repo_path)`.
        The purpose and significance of this return value can be broken down into two aspects:
        1. Identifying Cloned Repository Path: After cloning or updating the repository, `clone_github_repo` converts the repository path object to string format using `str()`, which is then returned as `str(repo_path)`. This allows easy integration with other parts of the codebase where a string representation of the local repository location might be required for further analysis or manipulation.
        2. Facilitating Further Code Execution: The `return str(repo_path)` output plays an essential role in connecting `clone_github_repo` with other functions like `py2dataset`. When the script encounters a GitHub repository URL as the starting directory ('start'), it clones or updates the repository before passing its path to `py2dataset`, enabling the processing of Python files present within this location. In summary, `str(repo_path)` ensures seamless integration between these functions by providing access to the local clone's address for subsequent operations in the pipeline.'
  get_bool_from_input:
    Inputs:
      Value: input_str, current_value
      Purpose: 'Within the given context of "py2dataset/py2dataset.py" source code, specifically referring to the auxiliary function `get_bool_from_input`, input parameters involve a pair called [input_str, current_value]. The primary role of this function lies within an interactive mode option that enables users to dynamically modify certain arguments during runtime instead of sticking with default values.
        1. Input_str represents user input prompted by the program when seeking updates for specific parameter values. It acts as a string containing either the existing value followed by "[...]" or just a new desired setting without any brackets if no change is required in that particular case. This input allows users to adjust parameters interactively before executing the main task of generating datasets from Python files.
        2. Current_value represents the default or previous assigned state for the corresponding argument in question. When `get_bool_from_input` receives this parameter alongside input_str, it compares both strings to determine whether a change is necessary or not. This variable serves as a reference point for comparison and potential updating during interactive mode usage.
        The purpose of these inputs is closely linked with modifying global variables within the script while preserving their default behavior when users choose not to intervene in parameter adjustments during runtime. `get_bool_from_input` utilizes input_str to decide whether a change should occur or keep current_value intact by converting user input into appropriate boolean values if needed.'
    Calls:
      Value: input_str.lower
      Purpose: 'Within the "get_bool_from_input" function in the context given, two calls involving "input_str.lower()" play significant roles while working in tandem to handle user inputs during interactive mode when updating parameter values. These calls are responsible for ensuring consistent casing and making comparisons easier against predefined keywords representing boolean values ('true', 'false', or 'yes', 'no'). Here's a detailed breakdown of these operations:
        1. `input_str.lower()`: This method is invoked on the user input obtained from prompts in interactive mode where users enter new values for parameters after being asked to provide them or hit Enter to keep the default ones. It converts the string to lowercase before comparison takes place in the subsequent step. Normalizing the case of user inputs allows equitable matching regardless of their capitalization while comparing against fixed strings representing boolean values ('True', 'False', 'y', 'n'). This standardization helps avoid potential mismatches due to different casings and simplifies decision making within the function logic.
        2. The entire `get_bool_from_input` function uses these normalized inputs alongside current parameter values ('params[arg]') to decide if there is a change needed or not for a particular argument (by comparing input segments against desired boolean options). By invoking 'input_str.lower()' at the start, consistency is enforced so the further conditional check is seamless, enhancing clarity and making sure it evaluates as expected based on user input provided.'
    Variables:
      Value: input_str, current_value
      Purpose: 'In the context given from 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', the function get_bool_from_input serves primarily during interactive mode to gather user input for modifying certain parameters while running the script in command-line arguments without rigid fixations. Inside this auxiliary method, there are two main variables playing important roles: input_str and current_value.
        1. input_str represents user input obtained from prompting for a specific parameter change within interactive mode. This variable holds whatever users type when asked to provide a new value for a particular argument. It helps capture their preference dynamically during runtime instead of sticking with default settings.
        2. current_value, on the other hand, stands as the existing or initial state of a parameter before entering interactive mode. This variable stores the original value assigned to a specific argument in the code before any user intervention. When users do not provide an alternative input (just pressing Enter), current_value remains unchanged as it retains its original setting.
        The purpose of combining these two variables within get_bool_from_input is to determine whether users want to keep the existing value or replace it with a new one based on their input string comparison against predefined keywords ('True', 'False'). If input_str matches these values ('true', 'false', 'y', 'yes', 'n', 'no'), it gets translated into equivalent Python boolean equivalents True/False; otherwise, current_value stays unaltered. These modified or retained parameter settings are then utilized within the main function (main()) to execute the overall process dynamically adjusted according to user preferences.'
    Returns:
      Value: current_value, True, False
      Purpose: "Within the context given in 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', the function get_bool_from_input serves primarily as a utility during interactive mode operation when asking users for changes related to some arguments' values. It handles obtaining revised parameters after getting input strings from prompt corresponding to specific flags or keeping their original state if no alteration is required. The purpose and significance of its returns - [current_value, True, False] are as follows:\n\n1. current_value: This return represents the initial boolean value associated with a parameter before seeking user input during interactive mode execution. If the user's input matches keywords like \"true\", \"t\", or \"yes\", the output keeps current_value set as true (denoting changed-but-preserved consistency in essence); else returns current_value untouched without modifying its truthiness status.\n\n2. True: This return value is generated when the user's input matches keywords such as \"true\", \"y\", or \"yes\". In this case, the function alters the parameter to true, indicating a conscious change made by the user to set it from its initial state represented by current_value.\n\n3. False: When receiving user inputs that match keywords like \"false\", \"n\", or \"no\" within interactive mode, get_bool_from_input modifies the corresponding parameter to false, signifying another intentional adjustment made by the user during runtime.\n\nIn summary, these three returns from `get_bool_from_input` help adaptively manage boolean parameters according to user choices inside the script while running interactively\u2014current_value as initial stability against inputs with contradicting keyword recognition converted either to True or False if a valid conversion happens (true when accepting change requests and false when rejecting them)."
  main:
    Calls:
      Value: 'len, print, sys.exit, input_str.lower, .join, isinstance, arg_string.replace, arg_string.split, value_segment.split(' --')[0].strip, value_segment.split, input(f'{arg} [{params[arg]}]: ').strip, input, get_bool_from_input, params.pop, params['start'].startswith, clone_github_repo, os.path.isdir, os.getcwd, py2dataset'
      Purpose: 'In the 'main' function within the given context of 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', various built-in functions and user-defined methods are employed to handle command-line arguments, interactivity, and execution flow management. Here is a breakdown of their purposes and significance:
        1. len(): Used for checking if there are any additional parameters apart from required ones when verifying the length of sys.argv - It confirms if help information should be displayed based on the count (excluding program name itself).
        2. print() & sys.exit(): These Python print and exit functions are utilized to display helpful messages during runtime, such as showing usage instructions when "--help" or "-h" flags are detected in command-line arguments or terminating the script gracefully after processing datasets successfully.
        3. input_str.lower(), .join(), value_segment.split(' --')[0].strip(), value_segment.split(): These string manipulation methods assist in parsing user inputs during interactive mode (enabled when 'I' flag is present). They help convert user responses to lowercase for easier comparison with options or obtain useful sections separated from interactive strings where '-Argument name Value or "Enter for Default' exists by split functions with delimitation performed near parameter labels like ' -- '.
        4. isinstance(): This built-in function checks the data type of parameters obtained during interactive mode to ensure they are booleans when converting user inputs into appropriate values using get_bool_from_input(). It handles switching between string representations ("True", "False", or entered empty line maintaining original state) of arguments effectively.
        5. arg_string.replace(), arg_string.split(): These string manipulation methods are used to remove unnecessary parts from the argument string after collecting command-line parameters for setting values in 'params' dictionary. They help separate individual flags and their respective values for further processing.
        6. input(f'{arg} [{params[arg]}]: ') & input(): Interactive mode prompts users to enter new values for specific arguments if 'I' flag is set. The first call displays a customized message with current parameter name and value, while the second one waits for user input without any prompt prefix when no modification is needed. Both collect user responses that are later processed by get_bool_from_input().
        7. get_bool_from_input(): A custom function handling interactive mode conversion of user inputs into boolean values based on their matching with true/false keywords ('y', 'n', 't', 'f' etc.) or leaving input unchanged for keeping existing boolean parameter value ('True', 'False'). This provides a simple and user-friendly interface during execution.
        8. params.pop(): Removes an interactive mode flag ('I') from the dictionary after processing user inputs in case it was set initially, ensuring subsequent operations do not invoke unnecessary interactive steps.
        9. params['start'].startswith('https://github.com/''): Checks whether a provided start directory points to a GitHub repository URL when preparing dataset generation within py2dataset function - It ensures invoking clone_github_repo() for proper dataset collection.
        10. clone_github_repo(): A user-defined function invoked when the starting directory corresponds to a GitHub URL, handling repository cloning or updating the local copy if available by using 'Repo' from PyGithub package - This provides required Python files when analyzing datasets for specific Git repositories.
        11. os.path.isdir(): Used in conjunction with 'start', validates its provided directory exists as a file path; otherwise, it takes current working directory (cwd) by default during dataset processing in py2dataset() to prevent crashes caused by non-existing locations.
        12. os.getcwd(): Obtains the pathname of the present working directory if neither "--start" argument is specified nor 'start' contains a GitHub repository URL for setting base operation conditions (most commonly executed situation).
        13. py2dataset(): Triggers execution of overall process flow defined within py2dataset.py with obtained parameter settings in 'params' - It begins collecting instruct.json datasets based on configuration chosen via command-line inputs and interprets GitHub repository URLs if necessary. This function is the core operation after preparing arguments through main().'
    Variables:
      Value: arg_string, user_input, params, value_segment
      Purpose: 'In the given context of 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py' file under discussion, especially in relation to the `main()` function which acts as a command-line entry point, four primary variables stand out namely - arg_string, user_input, params, and value_segment. These variables contribute significantly towards managing runtime parameters adjustments during execution when invoked with arguments from users or through interactive mode.
        1. arg_string: This variable holds the string representation of all command-line arguments passed after executing the script excluding the program name itself ('python py2dataset.py ...'). It helps in parsing these arguments and associating them with corresponding parameters defined within `params` dictionary. In interactive mode, it serves as a buffer to hold intermediate input segments while obtaining updated values for parameters.
        2. user_input: Specifically significant during interactive mode operation, user_input represents the user response when prompted to update any parameter value manually. It acts as an interface between developers and the script, allowing them to change settings without modifying the code directly. The input string is processed using `get_bool_from_input()` or kept unchanged if no alteration is desired.
        3. params: This dictionary contains default configurations/parameters used by different functions in `py2dataset`, making it central for processing Python files and generating datasets efficiently. Inside `main()`, 'params' serves as a dynamic pool storing collected argument values extracted from cmd lines or through user input (when Interactive flag set) providing versatile functionalities without forcing static behavior during execution.
        4. value_segment: When parsing arguments with the format "--parameter_name <value>", value_segment isolates the actual input value following '--parameter_name' string from arg_string in `main()`. This temporary variable holds new user-specified values before being assigned to corresponding entries in the `params` dictionary during interactive mode execution.
        In summary, arg_string manages command-line arguments parsing, user_input captures user interactions for parameter updates (if needed), params stores dynamic configurations derived from cmd lines or manual inputs, and value_segment assists in separating new values assigned to parameters within the interactive mode of `main()`. These variables collaborate to provide flexibility while running the script with various options or user-driven modifications.'
    Returns:
      Value: current_value, True, False
      Purpose: 'Within the given context of 'py2dataset/py2dataset.py', the function `get_bool_from_input()` is utilized only during interactive mode to obtain user input for changing parameters related to boolean values in the script. The triplet `[current_value, True, False]`, specifically arises within its execution since these returns denote altered or preserved Boolean parameters following users' choice via console prompts. In `main()`, this auxiliary function is invoked when `params["I"]` (interactive mode flag) is set to True.
        When analyzing the three possible outcomes from `get_bool_from_input(user_input, params[arg])`, each serves distinct purposes inside the interactive environment:
        1. **current_value**: Reflects an original default or previously input Boolean value before prompting users for modification. If users don't provide any new input (just press Enter), this value remains unchanged as no update is required.
        2. **True**: Indicates that user input matches keywords associated with a true state ('t', 'true', 'y', 'yes'). This means the parameter should be toggled to True during runtime adjustments.
        3. **False**: Represents cases where user input aligns with false-related terms ('f', 'false', 'n', 'no'), signifying that the corresponding parameter must switch to False in the script configuration.
        In summary, these returns from `main` through `get_bool_from_input()` facilitate dynamic adjustments of Boolean parameters during interactive mode by reflecting current state retention, affirmative user choices updating to True or negative user input being changed into False within `params` dictionary defined globally across the entire Python file.'
