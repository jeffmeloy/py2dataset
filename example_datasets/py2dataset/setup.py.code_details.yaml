py2dataset/setup.py:
  Code Documentation:
  - 'I) Description:
    The given context focuses on a Python file named `setup.py` within the `py2dataset` project directory using Setuptools library for package configuration and distribution management during software development. This script facilitates metadata generation required to distribute Python packages via platforms like PyPI (Python Package Index). It specifies details such as name, version, author, license, dependencies, entry points, and installation requirements.
    II) Detailed Requirements, API Signatures & Logic Breakdown:
    a. setuptools - A widely used Python library to assist developers in packaging and distributing their Python projects using Distutils extensions for easier installation. It helps create installers (e.g., `.egg`, `bdist_wheel`, etc.), generate documentation, and manage metadata related to the project package structure.
    b. `open("README.md", "r")` - Opens a file named 'README.md' in read mode to extract its content for long description usage during installation or distribution.
    c. `setup()` function - A core function from Setuptools that takes various keyword arguments to define package properties. In this context:
    i. name - Unique identifier of the project ('py2dataset')
    ii. version - Version number of the package ('0.4')
    iii. author & author_email - Developer's information ('Jeff Meloy', 'jeffmeloy@gmail.com')
    iv. description - Brief explanation about the project ('A tool to generate structured datasets from Python source code')
    v. long_description - Detailed explanation read from README file using markdown format ('text/markdown')
    vi. url - Link pointing to GitHub repository for more details ('https://github.com/jeffmeloy/py2dataset')
    vii. py_modules - List of Python modules in the package ('get_code_graph', 'get_params', 'get_python_datasets', 'get_python_file_details', 'py2dataset', 'save_output')
    viii. classifiers - Specifies attributes like programming language ('Python 3'), license type (MIT License), and operating system compatibility (OS Independent)
    ix. python_requires - Minimum Python version requirement ('>=3.8')
    x. install_requires - External dependencies needed to run the package ('matplotlib', 'networkx', 'ctransformers', 'PyYaml', 'GitPython')
    xi. entry_points - Defines console scripts accessible via command line ('py2dataset = py2dataset:main')
    xii. packages - Package structure ('py2dataset') with relative path mapping ('\\')
    III) Inputs, Variables, Calls & Returns Explanation:
    a. `install_requires` - A list containing names of required external libraries needed for package execution ('matplotlib', 'networkx', 'ctransformers', 'PyYaml', 'GitPython'). These dependencies are installed automatically when users install the `py2dataset` package using pip or similar tools.
    b. `entry_points` - A dictionary mapping console scripts to their respective modules and functions ('console_scripts': ['py2dataset = py2dataset:main']). This allows users to execute `py2dataset` as a command-line script pointing to the `main()` function in the `py2dataset` module.
    c. `packages` - A dictionary defining package structure with relative path mapping ('py2dataset': '.\\'). It helps Setuptools locate modules correctly during installation and import processes.

  Dependencies:
    Value: setuptools
    Purpose: "Regarding the given context focusing on a 'setup.py' file with Setuptools integration, let's break down the importance of Setuptools itself and elaborate on each mentioned dependency one by one:\n\n1. Setuptools Purpose and Significance:\n   - Setuptools is an essential Python library widely utilized in software development to streamline packaging and distribution processes for Python projects. It offers various functionalities such as creating installers (e.g., '.egg', 'bdist_wheel'), generating documentation, managing metadata related to the package structure, automating testing tasks, and easing dependencies management. In summary, Setuptools simplifies creating professional-grade packages for distribution on platforms like PyPI (Python Package Index).\n\n2. Dependencies Description:\n   a) matplotlib:\n      - Matplotlib is a widely used Python visualization library that creates static, animated, and interactive visual representations of data through plots such as histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, etc. In the given code context, it might be required for presenting generated datasets graphically or other relevant project features involving visualization.\n   b) networkx:\n      - NetworkX is a Python library designed for modeling and analyzing complex networks like social networks, internet graphs, or biological pathways. It provides data structures and algorithms related to graphs which can help process the relationships between different components within Python codebase structures when generating datasets. Its presence indicates potential network analysis use cases within the 'py2dataset' package.\n   c) ctransformers:\n      - CTransformers is a library optimized for machine learning tasks utilizing the Google Transformer architectures such as BERT and RoBERTa models written in Cython, allowing for improved speed while reducing resource usage compared to PyTorch counterparts. As its name suggests ('C' from 'Cython'), it also implies accelerated computations due to underlying C programming language advantages over pure Python implementation. In this project, cTransformers could be involved with Natural Language Processing tasks within dataset generation from source code.\n   d) PyYaml:\n      - PyYAML is a YAML parser for Python designed to work seamlessly with YAML formatted configuration files commonly used in modern applications' settings management and serialization needs. This dependency could handle dataset storage format translation from the structured Python objects created by 'py2dataset'. It converts between YAML strings and native Python data structures.\n   e) GitPython:\n      - GitPython is a Python library providing an easy interface to interact with Git repositories, enabling users to perform various operations like cloning, fetching, pushing, committing changes, etc., without invoking the command-line Git client directly. Its inclusion suggests potential Git integration within 'py2dataset', allowing developers to manage version control while working on Python codebases and dataset generation processes.\n\nIn summary, each dependency in this context enhances 'py2dataset' capabilities in various aspects: visualization, complex network analysis, optimized Machine Learning processing, dataset serialization with YAML support, and Git integration. Together, they form a rich environment to facilitate efficient structured datasets extraction from Python source codes."
