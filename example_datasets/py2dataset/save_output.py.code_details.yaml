  Code Documentation:
  - 'I) Purpose of py2dataset/save_output.py: The script encompasses utility functions essential for reading input data primarily in JSON and YAML formats, converting it to HTML files, processing JSONs, saving generated graphical images depicting code relationships as PNGs, handling Python file details extraction, and organizing output files systematically. It aims to facilitate the management of datasets related to programming tasks such as code documentation generation and analysis.
    II) Detailed Requirements, API Signatures & Logic Breakdown:
    A. read_file(): This function takes a file path (as Path type argument), detects whether the input file is JSON or YAML format by checking its extension, opens it using `with open()`, reads and returns the contents as a dictionary through `json.load` or `yaml.load`.
    API Signature: `read_file(file_path: Path) -> Dict`
    B. write_file(): Accepts a dictionary data along with a file path (both Path type arguments), writes the provided dictionary to JSON or YAML format by detecting the extension, manipulates some YAML specific behaviors like ignoring aliases and saving the result using `json.dump` or `yaml.Dumper`.
    API Signature: `write_file(data: Dict, file_path: Path) -> None`
    C. convert_json_to_html(): Targets a given directory containing JSON files; iterates through each JSON file excluding specified exceptions, reads their contents using read_file(), creates HTML content preserving spaces and tabs in tables for each dataset entry, writes the generated HTML content to a new file with .html extension.
    API Signature: `convert_json_to_html(directory: str) -> None`
    Notes: Includes calls like `pathlib`, string manipulations through functions like preserve_spacing().
    D. preserve_spacing(): Takes text input and tab width as arguments, replaces newlines with non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and tabs with a specific number of non-breaking spaces (tab_width).
    API Signature: `preserve_spacing(text: str, tab_width: int = 4) -> str`
    E. combine_json_files(): Processes JSON files within an input directory, merges them into 'instruct.json', removes duplicates, generates additional JSON files ('document_code.json' and 'shargpt.json'), handles YAML code_details.yaml file aggregation when `html` flag is true by calling convert_json_to_html().
    API Signature: `combine_json_files(directory: str, html: bool, questions: Dict) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]`
    Notes: Uses logging functions like `logging.info`, pathlib methods (Path), file manipulation functions. Creates specific data lists during operations, performs conversion calls with YAML, JSON.
    F. create_code_graph(): Generates graph representations using Python code information gathered in 'file_details', creates a DiGraph object using networkx library, draws the graph using matplotlib's plt module, saves it as a PNG image in an output subdirectory.
    API Signature: `create_code_graph(file_details: dict, base_name: str, output_subdir: Path) -> None`
    Notes: Requires networkx imports; relies on plt methods like figure(), spring_layout(), draw(), draw_networkx_edge_labels(); logging error handling is done when creating graphs fails.
    G. save_python_data(): Takes Python file details, instruction list data, relative path, and output directory as arguments; saves the Python file details as YAML ('details.yaml'), instruction data as JSON ('instruct.json'), generates code graph images using create_code_graph().
    API Signature: `save_python_data(file_details: dict, instruct_list: list, relative_path: Path, output_dir: str) -> None`
    Notes: Involves pathlib operations like creating subdirectories; logging error handling is done when generating graphs fails.

  Dependencies:
    Value: html, json, yaml, pathlib, networkx, logging, typing, matplotlib.pyplot
    Purpose: 'In the given context of py2dataset/save_output.py script, various dependencies play crucial roles to achieve its functionalities related to data handling, visualization, logging errors, and file manipulation. Here's a breakdown of each dependency's purpose and significance within the code:
      1. html: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not directly imported as a dependency but serves as an output format when converting JSON files into human-readable tables during the `convert_json_to_html()` function call. This process enhances data readability for end users by transforming structured JSON data into web page format.
      2. json: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used due to its simplicity and ease of parsing in multiple programming languages. It acts as an input/output format throughout the script, particularly seen when reading ('read_file()') or writing ('write_file()') files using Python's standard library json module functions like `json.load()` and `json.dump()`.
      3. yaml: YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is also employed in data handling; Python packages PyYAML helps in parsing/manipulating it in this codebase. It's used for reading ('read_file()') or writing ('write_file()') files with `yaml.load()`, `yaml.SafeDumper`, and `yaml.SafeLoader`.
      4. pathlib: The Python standard library module 'pathlib' offers convenient file system interactions, allowing manipulation of file paths as objects rather than strings. It is used across various functions such as creating absolute paths ('Path(directory)'), retrieving suffixes from filenames ('json_file.suffix[1:]'), constructing relative paths ('relative_path.as_posix()', 'output_subdir / relative_path.parent') or determining the presence of certain files ('Path(directory).rglob("*.instruct")').
      5. networkx: An external package for working with graphs and networks in Python, networkx helps generate graph representations in `create_code_graph()` by providing data structure 'DiGraph', defining edges between nodes and eventually visualizing these relationships using matplotlib.
      6. logging: Python's built-in logging module enables error tracking and message output during runtime. It is utilized to log informational messages ('logging.info'), errors ('logging.error') in different functions like `convert_json_to_html()`, `combine_json_files()`, or `create_code_graph()`.
      7. typing: Although not directly imported as a dependency, Python's typing module is utilized implicitly via type hinting annotations throughout the codebase to improve readability and clarity of function signatures ('-> Dict', 'Args:', 'Returns:'). These annotations help developers understand input/output types expected by each function.
      8. matplotlib.pyplot: A Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this script, it's part of `create_code_graph()` where it draws graphs representing code relationships using plt methods like 'plt.figure()', 'nx.draw()', 'nx.spring_layout()', and 'nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels()'. The generated graph is then saved as a PNG image for further usage or documentation purposes.'
  Functions:
    Value: read_file, write_file, convert_json_to_html, preserve_spacing, combine_json_files, create_code_graph, save_python_data
    Purpose: 'In the given context related to py2dataset's save_output.py script, a set of vital functions play particular roles towards facilitating diverse tasks centered around managing dataset handling, conversions, organizing outputs, code relationship representation through graphs, and data persistence across formats such as JSON, YAML, and HTML. Let's analyze each function:
      1. read_file(file_path): Its purpose is to retrieve contents from either JSON or YAML files identified by their extensions. It reads the file using appropriate Python libraries (json or yaml) after opening it with 'with open()'. This function is significant as it enables loading data stored in these formats into memory for further processing.
      2. write_file(data, file_path): This function writes a given dictionary to JSON or YAML files based on the detected extension while saving them back to disk. It contributes by ensuring data persistence after manipulation or extraction processes.
      3. convert_json_to_html(directory): The primary objective is to transform JSON files within a specified directory into HTML format, preserving spaces and tabs in tables for better readability. This function helps visualize dataset contents more conveniently by converting them into web page-friendly formats.
      4. preserve_spacing(text, tab_width): A utility function that replaces newlines with non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and tabs with a given number of non-breaking spaces (tab_width). Its significance lies in ensuring accurate spacing is preserved during HTML file creation for maintaining code indentation and formatting while converting JSON files into HTML tables.
      5. combine_json_files(directory, html, questions): This function combines all JSON files within a directory into 'instruct.json', removes duplicates, generates additional JSON files ('document_code.json' and 'shargpt.json'), handles YAML code_details.yaml file aggregation when the 'html' flag is true by calling convert_json_to_html(). Its purpose is to consolidate data from various files for efficient utilization across the codebase, allowing other functionalities access to integrated dataset contents in specified formats or as HTML.
      6. create_code_graph(file_details, base_name, output_subdir): It generates graph representations based on Python file details extracted through 'file_details'. Using networkx and matplotlib libraries, it creates a visualization of code relationships (as PNG images). This function significantly helps analyze program structure or dependencies by illustrating code flows within Python files.
      7. save_python_data(file_details, instruct_list, relative_path, output_dir): Taking Python file details along with instruction list data and directory paths as input, it saves the former as YAML ('details.yaml') and latter as JSON ('instruct.json'). Additionally, it generates code graph images using create_code_graph(). This function ensures comprehensive data persistence in various formats while also providing visual representations of code relationships for better understanding.'
  read_file:
    Inputs:
      Value: file_path
      Purpose: 'In the context given for py2dataset/save_output.py, the object 'file_path' holds significant importance within the function named 'read_file'. This function primarily focuses on reading contents from input files in either JSON or YAML format. The 'file_path' argument serves as an entry point to locate these files and understand their file structure. It helps identify which file extension, be it JSON or YAML, needs processing to retrieve its contents as a dictionary object that will later be utilized further within the program's execution flow.
        More specifically for 'read_file':
        1. 'file_path' is passed as Path type argument - This ensures efficient path handling regardless of operating systems since Path library abstracts away many platform differences in file paths.
        2. The function reads the contents by opening the file using a context manager ('with file_path.open()') which guarantees proper closing after use, irrespective of exceptions occurring during processing.
        3. Once opened, it checks the file extension ('file_type = file_path.suffix[1:]'), thus distinguishing between JSON and YAML files based on their suffixes ('json' or 'yaml'). This step is crucial for selecting appropriate parsing methods - json.load() for JSON files and yaml.load() for YAML files.
        4. With the chosen parser, it reads the file contents into memory as a dictionary data structure, which becomes the return value of this function. Thus, 'file_path' is essential in providing access to input data stored on disk and facilitating further operations throughout the codebase.'
    Calls:
      Value: file_path.open, json.load, yaml.load
      Purpose: 'In the context given for py2dataset/save_output.py's read_file() function, three notable calls play crucial roles: file_path.open(), json.load(), and yaml.load(). These calls serve to read data from input files with either JSON or YAML format and prepare them as Python dictionaries for further processing within the script.
        1. file_path.open(): This call opens the specified file path provided as an argument in readable mode using Python's built-in Pathlib feature "Path" called 'file_path'. It prepares the file handle to read its contents later on. Opening files allows reading their data into memory for further manipulations and analysis.
        2. json.load(): After opening the file, json.load() function reads JSON formatted data from the opened filehandle using its built-in capabilities in Python's standard library module 'json'. It parses the JSON content as a Python dictionary object, making it easily accessible for further operations within the script.
        3. yaml.load(): If the input file has YAML format instead of JSON, yaml.load() comes into play from Python's built-in library 'yaml'. Similar to json.load(), this function reads and converts YAML content into a Python dictionary while handling its unique syntax. This enables treating both JSON and YAML files similarly in the read_file() function despite their distinct data formats. The SafeLoader is used here for safe parsing of user-generated YAML data to avoid security issues.
        In summary, these calls (file_path.open(), json.load(), yaml.load()) are significant as they enable reading input files in various formats (JSON or YAML) and converting them into Python dictionaries for easy handling within the read_file() function of py2dataset/save_output.py script. This ensures flexibility when dealing with different data structures while maintaining a consistent data representation throughout the program's execution.'
    Variables:
      Value: file_type, file_path
      Purpose: 'In the given context within the 'read_file' function of py2dataset/save_output.py, 'file_type' and 'file_path' are significant elements defining the nature of data reading operation while operating with provided file paths. Both these variables come into action at various critical junctions ensuring precise manipulations considering JSON or YAML file formats.
        1. file_type: This variable stores the suffix after the dot ('"."') in a given Path object's extension (e.g., '.json' or '.yaml'). It serves as an identifier for distinguishing between JSON and YAML files when processing data. Within the 'read_file' function, file_type determination influences subsequent steps of detecting format-specific parsing mechanisms employed using 'json' and 'yaml' libraries. This allows seamless data extraction and handling of input files based on their format.
        2. file_path: It represents a Path object containing the complete path to the JSON or YAML file being processed by the function. The 'read_file' function opens this path in read-mode ('with open()'), leveraging the contained file content which later gets decoded as Python dictionary format for either JSON or YAML data using respective libraries ('json.load()' or 'yaml.load'). This variable is crucial to accessing and reading the actual input data stored at a specific location in the file system before performing further processing in different modules.
        Thus, the variables 'file_type' and 'file_path', both integral to the 'read_file' function, contribute significantly towards identifying file formats accurately and facilitating data extraction from appropriate locations within the input files. Their combined usage ensures proper handling of diverse file types encountered during program execution.'
    Returns:
      Value: '{}, json.load(f), yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader)'
      Purpose: 'In the given context within the 'read_file' function inside py2dataset/save_output.py, three different return values are associated with distinct scenarios depending on the file type detected by its extension during processing. Here are the detailed descriptions of those returns focused specifically around parsing JSON or YAML contents stored at lines referring to 'requirements':
        1. {}; this empty dictionary object '{}' is returned when an exception occurs while attempting to read a file inside the try-except block. This might happen due to incorrect file path handling, invalid file access permissions, or other unexpected errors during file reading operations. It ensures a graceful failure mode by providing a default value in case something goes wrong with the file processing.
        2. json.load(f): When the detected file extension is ".json", Python's built-in JSON library function 'json.load()' is invoked to read and parse the contents of the file into a dictionary format. This action allows easy manipulation and further utilization of the data stored in JSON structure within the codebase.
        3. yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader): For files having ".yaml" extension or any other YAML format identified, an alternate parser method involving YAML module functionality gets used as specified via yaml.load(...). An explicit safe loader, Yaml.SafeLoader() from YAML module parameters, enhances secure file loading by ignoring aliases during parsing. This feature prevents potential security issues arising due to circular references or alias-related problems in the loaded data. Thus, 'yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader)' returns a parsed dictionary object from YAML files ensuring safe processing and usage within the codebase.'
  write_file:
    Inputs:
      Value: data, file_path
      Purpose: 'In the context given for py2dataset/save_output.py code, within the `write_file()` function definition, two main inputs play significant roles - [data] and [file_path]. The purpose of these arguments is to facilitate writing data contents into a file in either JSON or YAML format depending on its extension identified by examining the suffix after converting `file_path` to a Path object.
        1. data (Dict): This argument represents the content that needs to be saved inside the file. It can be any Python dictionary holding information that needs persistence in a storage medium such as JSON or YAML files. In other words, 'data' acts as the actual content to be written into the output file.
        2. file_path (Path): This input specifies the exact location where the data will be stored after processing. It is a Path object obtained from Python's pathlib module that provides convenient operations for working with filesystem paths. The function uses this argument to determine the file type based on its extension and then writes the 'data' into it using appropriate methods like `json.dump()` or `yaml.SafeDumper`.
        In summary, 'data' carries the information to be stored while 'file_path' defines where exactly in the filesystem this data should be saved as either JSON or YAML format after processing through `write_file()`. Together they ensure proper handling of data persistence according to user requirements.'
    Calls:
      Value: file_path.open, json.dump, yaml.dump, float
      Purpose: 'In the context given from py2dataset/save_output.py's write_file() function, four notable calls are utilized to achieve writing data into files with either JSON or YAML format based on the detected extension. Here's an explanation for each one:
        1. file_path.open(): This operation initiates opening a specified file using Pathlib's path object 'file_path'. It allows reading and modifying its contents in subsequent steps. In JSON case, it sets up a connection to write data into the file later on. For YAML format, it prepares for writing after necessary manipulations are done by yaml library functions.
        2. json.dump(): This built-in Python function is used when the detected file extension indicates JSON format (i.e., 'file_type == "json"'). It serializes a given dictionary ('data') into JSON format with an indentation level of 4 spaces for better readability and writes it to the opened file created by 'file_path.open()'. This ensures data persistence in JSON format.
        3. yaml.dump(): In case the detected extension is YAML ('file_type == "yaml"'), this function from PyYAML library serializes a dictionary into YAML format after applying specific behaviors like ignoring aliases and setting parameters such as width, sort keys, flow style, etc., to ensure proper representation. Similar to json.dump(), it writes the transformed data to the opened file ('file_path').
        4. float(): Although not directly involved in write_file() itself, its presence in the context refers to rounding column_width calculation ("column_width = round(100 / column_count, 2)") with two decimal places. This ensures precision when defining table widths in convert_json_to_html() function but doesn't relate explicitly to write_file(). However, it shows how Python float datatype supports calculations across different functions within the codebase.
        In summary, file_path.open(), json.dump(), yaml.dump(), and float are critical parts of the write_file() function responsible for handling diverse data writing requirements depending on input file formats while maintaining readability standards. They ensure persistence of data in either JSON or YAML format according to the detected extension.'
    Variables:
      Value: data, file_type, file_path
      Purpose: 'In the context given for the function 'write_file', the variables data, file_type, and file_path hold crucial roles in determining how to handle and save the provided input dictionary content. Here's a breakdown of their purposes and significance within this function:
        1. data (Dict): This variable represents the primary input argument for write_file(). It is a Python dictionary containing key-value pairs that need to be written into an output file. In most cases, it will be obtained from other functions like read_file() where data extraction occurs from JSON or YAML files.
        2. file_type (str): This variable stores the suffix of the input file path after removing its base name and extension separator ('.'). Its primary purpose is to identify whether the original file was in JSON or YAML format, allowing write_file() to choose appropriate methods for serialization when writing data back into a new file. If file_type equals "json", json.dump() will be used; otherwise (when file_type equals "yaml"), customized behavior with yaml libraries will apply to maintain desired formatting while dumping the data.
        3. file_path (Path): This argument is a pathlib Path object referring to the target location where write_file() should save the new output file. It represents the complete address of the file receiving the serialized data from 'data'. In contrast to data and file_type, which deal with content manipulation, file_path determines where this manipulated information will be stored permanently in the system's directory structure.
        Within write_file(), these variables collectively help achieve serialization of given dictionary data into a new JSON or YAML file at the specified path based on its original format detected through file_type. By using appropriate libraries (json and yaml), the function ensures compatibility with input files while preserving their formatting preferences during output generation.'
  convert_json_to_html:
    Inputs:
      Value: directory
      Purpose: "In the given context concerning the function `convert_json_to_html()`, the prominent input parameter named 'directory' refers to a string representing the path to a location containing JSON files. Its purpose and significance are central in driving this utility operation. The role of 'directory' within the function is twofold:\n\n1. Enumeration Process: The code iterates through each JSON file present inside the specified directory by employing Pathlib module functions like `Path(directory).rglob(\"*.json\")`. This step helps identify all JSON files in the given location for further processing and conversion into HTML format.\n\n2. File Handling & Transformation: After reading individual JSON files using 'read_file()', 'directory' assists in generating their corresponding HTML counterparts by creating relative file paths within the same directory structure. This allows saving the transformed content as .html files while maintaining a consistent organization of input and output data.\n\nIn summary, 'directory' acts as an essential input for `convert_json_to_html()` function since it defines the scope of operation\u2014identifying JSON files to convert into HTML format while preserving their original location hierarchy during the process."
    Calls:
      Value: text.replace(, &nbsp;').replace, text.replace, Path(directory).rglob, Path, read_file, len, dataset[0].keys, round, escape, str, preserve_spacing, value.replace, row_parts.append, html_rows.append, .join, json_file.with_suffix, open, file.write, logging.info
      Purpose: 'In the `convert_json_to_html` function within the given context, several object calls serve specific purposes to convert JSON files into HTML format while preserving spaces and tabs within tables. Here's a breakdown of each mentioned call:
        1. text.replace(, &nbsp;').replace: This operation is not directly present in `convert_json_to_html`. However, it belongs to the nested function 'preserve_spacing', which is used inside this function to replace newlines with non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and tabs with a specified number of non-breaking spaces.
        2. text.replace: In `preserve_spacing`, it replaces specific substrings within the given input string 'value'. This function helps maintain whitespace integrity while converting data into HTML format.
        3. Path(directory).rglob: This pathlib method iterates through all files in a given directory recursively, matching specified patterns ('*.json'). It is used to access JSON files for conversion into HTML format.
        4. Path: The 'pathlib' module class represents filesystem paths independently of operating systems. In `convert_json_to_html`, it is utilized for handling file paths within the directory and creating relative paths when saving converted HTML output.
        5. read_file(json_file): Function that retrieves a dictionary version of a JSON or YAML content, making available each document stored inside JavaScript Object Notation format JSON files processed further in this function.
        6. len: Python's built-in function to calculate the number of items within iterable objects such as lists or strings; it helps determine column width in HTML table creation.
        7. dataset[0].keys(): This call returns a list containing keys from the first dictionary entry in 'combined_data'. It is used to create HTML table headers with equal width distribution.
        8. round: A built-in function that rounds a given number to the nearest integer or specified decimal places. In `convert_json_to_html`, it helps calculate column width percentage for distributing space equally among columns in HTML tables.
        9. escape: From html library, this function converts characters with special meaning in HTML into their corresponding HTML entities, preventing parsing issues during rendering of converted files.
        10. str: Python's built-in data type used for textual representations and handling string operations; required when converting JSON content to HTML strings containing formatted tables.
        11. preserve_spacing(value): Function that preserves spaces and tabs within provided input text by replacing newlines with non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and tabs with a specified number of non-breaking spaces ('tab_width'). It ensures proper whitespace rendering in HTML tables generated from JSON data.
        12. value.replace("\n", "<br/>"): Substitutes line breaks ("\n") in extracted dataset content for <br/> HTML tags; improves readability and text wrapping when rendered as an HTML table cell content.
        13. row_parts.append(...): Append operation adds components of an individual HTML row (th tag, cell data enclosed in td) into the list 'row_parts' that is used later to generate HTML tables line by line for each JSON file entry.
        14. html_rows.append("".join(row_parts)): Combines all rows formed with row_parts into a single string and appends it to 'html_rows'. These strings represent table rows constructed from JSON datasets within an individual file processing cycle.
        15. json_file.with_suffix(".html"): Returns the JSON filename but replacing its original extension ('*.json') with '.html'; used for creating HTML output filenames during saving operations.
        16. open: Python's built-in function to open files in read/write mode; utilized here to create HTML files where converted content will be written.
        17. file.write(): Writes the generated HTML content into opened files created by 'open'. It saves each JSON file with transformed HTML format containing preserved whitespaces and tables representing dataset entries.
        18. logging.info: A module from Python's logging library used for outputting informational messages about specific events in the code execution flow, such as file reading failures or conversion processes. It helps track progress and issues during conversion tasks.'
    Variables:
      Value: html_content, row_parts, dataset, directory, column_count, html_rows, html_file_path, column_width, value
      Purpose: 'Within the `convert_json_to_html` function of the provided codebase, these given variables hold significant roles for generating HTML representation from input JSON files. Let's elaborate on their purposes individually:
        1. html_content: This variable stores an accumulating string containing the overall HTML structure for a single output file that comprises necessary header sections such as '<head>' and '<style>' blocks defining CSS style along with "<table>" and other important content within the '<body>'. During each JSON processing step in the loop, it gets updated with relevant table rows formed by combining column headers ('<th>') and data rows ('<td>').
        2. row_parts: This variable is a list used temporarily to construct an HTML row for each entry in dataset files. It holds four elements - '<tr>', a column value from the JSON file after necessary transformations, '</tr>', where each item gets appended as iteration progresses forming one row structure for a table representation.
        3. dataset: In `convert_json_to_html`, this variable initially contains all read JSON files' contents within the specified directory after applying `read_file()`. It is utilized to access data from these files while generating HTML output rows and preserving spacing as instructed by each file entry's keys and values.
        4. directory: This denotes the input path of the folder where all JSON files reside, which `convert_json_to_html` operates on for converting them into HTML format. It helps in locating individual JSON files using Pathlib methods like `Path(directory).rglob("*.json")`.
        5. column_count: This variable represents the number of columns present in each table row derived from the first JSON file entry's keys length after converting to list ('dataset[0].keys()'). It aids in dividing space evenly for column width calculations within the CSS styling block defined inside '<head>' section.
        6. html_rows: An empty list accumulating fully constructed HTML rows as Python builds table structure iteratively through dataset entries. Each processed row from `row_parts` is appended into this list to generate final output after finishing JSON files processing in the loop.
        7. html_file_path: A string variable holding a specific filename with '.html' extension, generated by removing '.json' suffix from input JSON file names within the directory loop. It signifies the target destination where converted HTML content will be saved using open('w', encoding='utf-8') function calls.
        8. column_width: A float value calculated as a percentage representing equal distribution of space among columns in the table structure. It is derived by dividing 100 by column count ('column_count') and rounding it to two decimal places ('round(100 / column_count, 2)').
        9. value: A generic term used inside loops where it refers to specific JSON key-value pairs within the dataset. It holds string representations of data extracted from JSON files for further manipulations like preserving spaces and newlines before writing them into HTML rows ('row_parts') or forming overall HTML content ('html_content').'
    Returns:
      Value: text.replace(, &nbsp;').replace('\\t, &nbsp;' * tab_width)
      Purpose: 'Within the given context of 'convert_json_to_html' function, the return statements are not explicitly mentioned as separate methods but embedded within its logic flow. However, we can identify two significant transformations performed on text during HTML content creation that contribute to generating HTML files from JSON data. These operations enhance preservation of whitespaces while converting JSON data into readable HTML tables.
        1. Purpose: text.replace(r"\n", "<br/>"): This substitution replaces all newline characters (\n) within the input text with <br/> HTML tags. This conversion ensures line breaks are preserved when displayed in web browsers rather than creating new lines in HTML code output, making it more visually appealing and easier to read.
        2. Significance: preserve_spacing(value=escape(str(entry[key])): This call handles both space replacements and tab-width conversion on input text portions, ensuring spacing and indentations remain consistent within the HTML tables while generating webpages from JSON files. Specifically, newlines (\n) get changed into "&nbsp;" meaning a nonbreaking space symbol while tabulations are altered using str() of the function defined earlier '(&nbsp;'*tab_width).
        In brief, both changes ensure accurate portrayal of spaces and tabs as desired within generated HTML content without distorting whitespaces present in the JSON file contents. Their role collectively helps create more structured HTML files presenting tabular data derived from JSON objects while retaining readability aspects inherent to original input.'
  preserve_spacing:
    Inputs:
      Value: text, tab_width
      Purpose: 'In the context given, particularly within the function 'preserve_spacing', the objects 'text' and 'tab_width' hold significant roles when invoked as arguments. This function aims to maintain spaces and tabs in a provided text while converting newlines into non-breaking spaces ('&nbsp;').
        1. text: Represents the original string or text input where spacing preservation is necessary. The primary objective of this argument is to identify spaces, tabs, line breaks (newlines), and other formatting elements in its current state. Preserving these formats helps retain important structural details while generating HTML content in 'convert_json_to_html()'.
        2. tab_width (with a default value of 4): Specifies the width measurement for replacing tabs with non-breaking spaces ('&nbsp;'). It determines how many non-breaking spaces should be used to represent each tab encountered during text processing, thus maintaining original indentation and layout information despite the change in formatting between different files or data structures. This attribute is essential as it allows 'preserve_spacing()' to respect initial coding conventions while converting JSON files into HTML format.
        In summary, both inputs ('text' and 'tab_width') contribute towards ensuring accurate representation of whitespaces and indentation when transforming data from JSON to HTML files within the 'convert_json_to_html()' function execution path of the py2dataset/save_output.py script.'
    Calls:
      Value: text.replace(, &nbsp;').replace, text.replace
      Purpose: 'In the given context within the function 'preserve_spacing', two instances of string replacement operations can be observed as part of transforming input text while preserving spaces and tabs. These calls contribute to maintaining formatting consistency in HTML output generation when converting JSON files to HTML format using `convert_json_to_html()`.
        1. text.replace("\n", "&nbsp;"): This replacement operation substitutes all newline characters ('\n') with non-breaking space entities (&nbsp;) within the input string 'text'. It ensures line breaks are represented as spaces in HTML format without creating separate lines, which helps maintain formatting when rendering tables in HTML content.
        2. text = text.replace("\t", "&nbsp;" * tab_width): This replacement operation substitutes each occurrence of a tab character ('\t') with a specified number of non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;). The tab width is defined by the 'tab_width' argument (default value 4), which determines how many non-breaking spaces should replace each tab. This preserves indentation and whitespace consistency in HTML output while keeping its formatting intact.
        Both replacements work together to ensure proper rendering of input data as HTML tables with preserved spacing and tabs, making the converted JSON files more readable when viewed in a web browser.'
    Variables:
      Value: tab_width, text
      Purpose: 'In the given context within the function 'preserve_spacing', objects tab_width and text hold specific roles contributing to its purpose. These variables are integral parts of transforming input text while maintaining spaces and tabs in their original formatting when converting it into HTML content for JSON files during conversion from JSON or YAML format.
        The 'tab_width' variable represents the desired width for each tab equivalent in non-breaking spaces ('&nbsp;') that will be used to replace actual tabs encountered within the input text. This parameter allows controlling how much space a tab should occupy when converted into HTML representation, ensuring consistent indentation is preserved across various code files or structures. By default, it has an initial value of 4 in the provided code snippet but can be modified if needed.
        On the other hand, 'text' signifies the input string that undergoes transformation through preserve_spacing(). It receives spaces and tabs replaced with non-breaking spaces ('&nbsp;') along with consecutive tab characters being substituted by a specified number of non-breaking spaces equal to the given tab width. This way, important formatting details like indentation are preserved in HTML output while still maintaining valid syntax for web browsers.'
    Returns:
      Value: text.replace(, &nbsp;').replace('\\t, &nbsp;' * tab_width)
      Purpose: 'Within the given context of py2dataset/save_output.py script, the function named preserve_spacing serves a specific purpose related to maintaining whitespace integrity while handling text conversion during HTML generation from JSON files. This function takes two arguments - 'text' representing the input string and an optional integer argument 'tab_width'. Its primary objective is to ensure that both spaces ('&nbsp;') and tabs are preserved in the transformed output text without altering their original appearance.
        The returned value after applying these replacements can be broken down into two parts of replace() operations acting sequentially:
        1. text.replace("\n", "&nbsp;"): It scans for all occurrences of '\n', replacing each instance with HTML representation of new line character as "non-breaking space". As a result, any line breaks within the input string will be rendered as continuous white spaces in HTML format without starting a new line.
        2. text.replace("\t", "&nbsp;" * tab_width): This portion seeks '\t', the ASCII code for tabulation. Replaced with tab_width multiple (&nbsp;) sequences creating white spaces equal to tab_width (defaulted as 4 in this case). Thus, each tab character is converted into a series of non-breaking spaces maintaining its original width while preserving tabs within the text.
        In summary, preserve_spacing() guarantees accurate whitespace rendering when converting JSON data into HTML tables, making sure both line breaks and tabs are preserved with their respective visual appearances. This is crucial for presenting structured data in a readable manner within HTML content generated from JSON files during conversion processes like convert_json_to_html().'
  combine_json_files:
    Inputs:
      Value: directory, html, questions
      Purpose: 'In the context given for the 'combine_json_files' function within py2dataset/save_output.py, the inputs directory, html, and questions hold significant roles in organizing and processing JSON files while generating additional output formats. Let's break down their purposes individually:
        1. directory (str): This input represents the path to a specific folder where all the JSON files to be processed reside. 'combine_json_files' uses this argument extensively by traversing through all files within the provided directory, combining data from multiple JSONs, creating necessary subsidiary output files, and eventually generating HTML conversions when requested through html=True parameter value. This folder also holds code_details.yaml files containing extraction details saved by previous Python scripts as part of their operations.
        2. html (bool): As a boolean flag, html determines whether HTML conversion should be performed after combining JSON data into instruct.json. If set to True, the function will invoke convert_json_to_html() at the end of its operation, which transforms each processed JSON file into an equivalent HTML format and saves them with '.html' extensions for further analysis or documentation purposes. This parameter enables customization of output formats according to user requirements.
        3. questions (Dict): While not directly linked to JSON files manipulation within combine_json_files(), this input appears in its argument list due to nested function calls - more explicitly inside "purpose_question" creation step for generating document_code file from merged JSON data. This 'questions' variable usually originates elsewhere, most likely gathered by interrogating a Python script under analysis. It helps extract relevant information about the file purpose, particularly in locating instances where instructions start with "{filename}". These identified sections are further utilized to generate sharegpt.json with additional details. Thus, 'questions' facilitates enriching data associated with the processing pipeline while aiding post-combination file formation and classification within py2dataset framework.
        In summary, directory serves as the primary source of JSON files for combination and potential HTML conversion triggering; html decides whether to extend output formats beyond JSON; questions contribute contextual information about processed Python scripts for additional metadata creation after merging multiple datasets. All three inputs complement each other in handling JSON file processing with 'combine_json_files' while delivering different yet integral aspects of its functionalities.'
    Calls:
      Value: logging.info, Path(directory).rglob, Path, read_file, combined_data.extend, json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix(').as_posix().replace, json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix(').as_posix, json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix, json_file.relative_to, code_filename.append, write_file, purpose_question.split, item['instruction'].startswith, enumerate, len, conv['value'].encode, open, f.read, code_details.append, f.write, \\n'.join, convert_json_to_html
      Purpose: 'In the `combine_json_files` function within the py2dataset script, several key operations are performed to achieve its goal of combining JSON files into 'instruct.json', removing duplicates, generating additional JSON files ('document_code.json' and 'shargpt.json'), and managing code details when creating HTML representations is required. Let us dissect the listed calls for clarity:

        2. Path(directory).rglob(...): The pathlib library's Path class method recursively searches for files matching a given pattern within the specified directory and returns an iterator over Path objects representing those files. Here, it looks for all JSON files in the input directory.
        3. Path: This class from the pathlib module represents a file system path independent of operating systems and supports various operations on paths like combining, joining, splitting, etc. It's used to manage different output files locations.
        4. read_file(...): Extracts data in JSON or YAML format from selected files within iterated paths from 'rglob'. Its return value helps extend combined_data during dataset aggregation by loading contents as Python dictionaries.
        5. combined_data.extend(...): Appends the read file content to the existing combined_data list, merging JSON data from multiple sources into a single list.
        6. json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix('').as_posix().replace: This chain of pathlib methods extracts the filename without its extension and replaces unwanted characters to generate a cleaned name string used for code_filename append operation later in the function.
        7. json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix('').as_posix: Extracts just the file name relative to directory but with no suffix. This step creates cleaned names excluding the JSON extension only.
        8. json_file.relative_to(directory).with_suffix(''): Same as above but without appending any suffix; used for reference purposes.
        9. json_file.relative_to: Gets a path object representing the relative path to the directory from the file path (useful for other functions' arguments like writing data into JSON files with proper location information).
        10. code_filename.append(...): A list that holds cleaned names obtained previously is updated with these cleaned names during processing JSON files. This will be used while writing combined datasets to 'document_code.json'.
        11. write_file(...): Writes the aggregated data into 'instruct.json' after combining all JSON files in instruct_list format from combine_data operation. It saves these datasets without returning any value explicitly.
        12. purpose_question.split: This string method splits a text at specified delimiters to separate portions within a larger string ('file_purpose'). In the script, it divides 'file_purpose' based on '{filename}' marker.
        13. item['instruction'].startswith(...): Checks if an instruction starts with a particular pattern ('purpose_question') to identify relevant entries for creating 'document_code.json'.
        14. enumerate: A built-in Python function returns indexed pairs of items from iterables (like lists or tuples), which is helpful in tracking iteration position while processing JSON files.
        15. len(...): Returns the number of elements in a collection like strings, lists, etc., used to determine graph edges count for networkx library operations later.
        16. conv['value'].encode: Encodes string values into bytes required by matplotlib's plt module while drawing graphs (for edge labels).
        17. open(...), f.read(), f.write(): Input-output handling for YAML file data appending from individual '.code_details.yaml', collectively forming the output with \\n separation later stored at "code_details". The former reads the input data whereas second one writes contents as given.
        18. \n'.join(...): Joins strings with newline characters ('\\n') to create a single string for writing into 'code_details.yaml' file.
        19. convert_json_to_html(): If `html` flag is set true, converts JSON files in the directory into HTML format generating .html files. This helps in presenting data more visually readable formats like tables in web browsers if necessary.
        Overall, each of these calls performs an important function to effectively organize data flow during combining, manipulating files within given directories and managing different output formats in `combine_json_files`.'

        7. `questions:` A dictionary holding question-answer pairs related to Python file analysis. It helps identify specific patterns or keywords within instructions, such as 'file_purpose', which is used to find code descriptions connected with expected outputs ('purpose_question').
        8. `code_details:` A collection of textual content read from YAML files related to code graph details. These data will be later saved in 'code_details.yaml'.
        9. `file_data:` Intermediate variable storing contents of YAML files during their aggregation process within the function. It is used when writing the final 'code_details.yaml' file after combining all relevant textual information.
        10. `cleaned_name:` The pathname relative to specified 'directory' derived by trimming certain filename portions in JavaScript notation ({filename}), preparing the filenames in anticipation for naming combined outputs accordingly like JSON files ('code filename').
        11. `purpose_question:` Extracted from questions dictionary by selecting 'file_purpose', it represents a string pattern containing curly braces placeholder ({filename}) used to identify relevant instructions related to output Python code descriptions ('document').
        12. `sharegpt:` A list of dictionaries representing converted JSON content for OpenAI's SHARE model interpretation - providing graph data extracted from parsed files after modifying node details as edges, including information on 'target_inputs' and 'target_returns'. This dataset is saved as 'shargpt.json'.
        In summary, these variables play crucial roles in handling JSON file consolidation, HTML conversion options, managing skipped files, organizing output data structures, tracking byte counts for graph generation contexts, processing questions related to Python code analysis, aggregating YAML content, and preparing essential inputs for further processing within the `combine_json_files` function.'
    Returns:

        9. G: An instance of networkx's DiGraph class that represents the actual code graph created during function execution. This object holds nodes representing Python file elements like functions, classes etc., edges showing dependencies between them along with associated attributes (target inputs and returns). It serves as a primary data structure for plotting operations using matplotlib's drawing methods.'
  save_python_data:
    Inputs:
      Value: file_details, instruct_list, relative_path, output_dir
      Purpose: 'In the context given for py2dataset/save_output.py, the function save_python_data serves as a crucial component that consolidates different pieces of information extracted from a Python file into separate output files while also generating code graph visualizations related to the input program. Here, [file_details, instruct_list, relative_path, output_dir] serve as fundamental parameters playing various roles to facilitate these objectives effectively:
        1. file_details: This parameter represents the extracted details from a specific Python file. It holds crucial information about the code such as file-level insights ("file_info") and code quality assessment response ("code_qa_response"). In save_python_data, file_details are utilized to create graphical representations of code relationships using create_code_graph() while also saving its contents as a YAML file named "{base_name}.details.yaml" within the specified output directory ({output_dir}).
        2. instruct_list: This list stores instruction data extracted from the analyzed Python file during execution. Within save_python_data, instruct_list is saved as JSON files with the name "{base_name}.instruct.json". These instructions are likely derived from code documentation analysis or understanding the purpose of different sections within the Python script.
        3. relative_path: This Path object signifies the relative path of the Python file being processed by save_python_data. It helps in identifying the position of the original Python file within a larger directory structure and assists in generating appropriate output filenames for organized storage in {output_dir}. By providing this information, save_python_data can create unique names for output files such as "{base_name}.details.yaml" and "{base_name}.code_details.yaml".
        4. output_dir: This string variable denotes the target directory where all generated outputs will be saved after processing Python file data. It acts as a base path to store YAML, JSON files containing instruction lists, code details, graphical representations of code relationships (PNG images), etc. By setting {output_dir}, save_python_data can create relevant subdirectories ({output_subdir}) within this parent directory when needed for proper organization of the resulting data.'
    Calls:
      Value: Path, output_subdir.mkdir, write_file, open, f.write, create_code_graph, logging.error
      Purpose: 'In the `save_python_data` function within py2dataset/save_output.py, various external libraries and built-in Python modules are utilized to accomplish its purpose of saving the details of a Python file as YAML format, instruction data as JSON files, generating graphical images depicting code relationships as PNGs, all organized systematically in designated output paths. Below is an elaboration on each highlighted object's role:
        1. Path: This built-in module assists in working with filesystem pathnames independently of the underlying operating system details. In `save_python_data`, Path is utilized primarily for relative path extraction (from input argument `relative_path`) to determine output directory structure during saving processes and creating required subdirectories where needed using absolute paths obtained through Path methods like parentage manipulations ('output_subdir = Path(output_dir) / relative_path.parent').
        2. output_subdir.mkdir: This operation leverages the Path object's 'mkdir()' method to create a new directory with given path (here 'output_subdir') along its parents if they don't already exist. This ensures proper storage structure preparation for output files prior to writing data. The statement ensures everything required to contain outputs exists ahead of performing writes in other tasks, thereby enabling better control and streamlined data arrangement within directories as demanded by code logic flow.
        3. write_file: A function imported from the current module itself, `write_file` is responsible for writing a dictionary to JSON or YAML files based on detected file extensions ('data', 'file_path') as described earlier in explanation points B and G. In `save_python_data`, it handles saving Python file details ('file_details') as 'details.yaml' in the designated output directory, as well as the instruction list ('instruct_list') into JSON format under the name 'instruct.json'.
        4. open: This built-in function is a standard tool for interacting with files by providing file access modes such as reading or writing. In `save_python_data`, it opens files to read existing content before overwriting them during YAML data saving operations ('output_text'). Additionally, it creates new files for writing HTML code details ('with open(output_subdir / f"{base_name}.code_details.yaml", "w")', enabling content manipulation before committing updates using write().
        5. f.write: After opening a file with 'open()', Python assigns it to variable 'f'. This write() method associated with the opened file object ('f') is used for writing data into the respective files, as demonstrated in saving YAML code details ('with open(output_subdir / f"{base_name}.code_details.yaml", "w") as f: f.write(output_text)'.
        6. create_code_graph: An internal function (detailed earlier under point F), `create_code_graph` generates graph representations from Python file details ('file_details'), creates DiGraph objects using networkx library, draws graphs using matplotlib's plt module functionality such as 'spring_layout()', 'draw()', 'draw_networkx_edge_labels()'. The role of create_code_graph within `save_python_data` lies in graphically portraying code relationships resulting from extracted information; the created PNG image will be stored as required. Although there is no explicit return value associated with this call, it influences data visualization in support of documentation comprehension and analysis purposes.
        7. logging.error: A Python library responsible for creating and managing logs, particularly providing logging mechanisms to track errors or messages during runtime execution. In `save_python_data`, it catches exceptions related to graph creation failures ('try: create_code_graph(file_details, base_name, output_subdir)') and reports them with contextual information ('logging.error(f"Error creating graph for {base_name}: {e}", exc_info=True)' for better debugging and traceability if errors occur during the process of generating code graphs.'
    Variables:
      Value: output_subdir, file_details, instruct_list, base_name, output_text, relative_path, output_dir
      Purpose: 'In the context of `save_python_data`, these variables play crucial roles in saving the details extracted from a Python file, structuring output files systematically, and managing diverse operations related to generating data representations. Let's elaborate their functions individually:
        1. output_subdir (Path): This variable represents the output directory path where all generated files will be saved after processing the input Python file. It is created within `save_python_data` by combining the given relative_path and output_dir arguments using Path operations to ensure proper organization of output files.
        2. file_details (dict): This variable holds the extracted details from the analyzed Python file containing information about its code structure, dependencies, and other relevant metadata necessary for creating graphical representations of code relationships. It is used primarily in `create_code_graph()` to generate code graphs depicting connections between different elements within the program.
        3. instruct_list (list): This variable stores the instruction data extracted from the Python file during processing. The instruction list represents a structured collection of parsed information required for further utilization or analysis purposes. In `save_python_data`, it is saved as JSON files ('instruct.json') after merging and cleaning JSON datasets obtained through combine operations in `combine_json_files()`.
        4. base_name (str): This variable denotes the base name of the input Python file used for generating output filenames throughout `save_python_data()`, maintaining naming conventions in relation to file formats (Python extension removal), saving various associated outputs for code representation clarity, and ensuring proper organization within the output directory.
        5. output_text (str): This string contains the textual representation of code details extracted from the Python file related to question responses in the code_qa format. In `save_python_data`, it is saved as 'code_details.yaml' using file handling operations within an output subdirectory after preprocessing for structured storage and potential further analysis.
        6. relative_path (Path): This object refers to the input Python file path relative to its containing directory, serving as a reference point during operations such as creating the output subdirectory and saving data representations related to that specific Python script within `save_python_data`.
        7. output_dir (str): This variable represents the overall target directory where all generated outputs will be saved after processing the input Python file. It is used in conjunction with relative_path to create the output subdirectory path for organizing files systematically and ensuring proper placement of results within the desired location.
        In summary, these variables collectively contribute towards saving Python file details as YAML format ('details.yaml'), instruction data as JSON ('instruct.json'), generating code graph images using `create_code_graph()`, maintaining a structured output organization throughout `save_python_data`.'
